When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 
- When I want to collaborate with other people. Essentially to make my code distributed.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- because I might not want all the work that is done on the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- forks are like clones but the concept only aplies to Github, clones are copies of repositories locally or from a remote, 
 while branches are nothing but commits branched.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-to know when conflicts arise between the remote repository and the local one.
