It showed me the difference between the two files

It allows me to see the changes I've made and I can 
go back to earlier versions if I want to.

it gives more flexibility, but I could forget to commit. 

Because they are not logically connected. 

git log command displays all the commits that have happened and the git diff
command allows me to compare to different commits with their id.

because it is easier to go back and forth between commits.
